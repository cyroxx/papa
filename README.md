PAPA - A Personal Automator
====

PAPA is meant to automate your life. Whether you want to be notified about
all status updates or tweets about a particular topic in your favorite
social media, download your monthly bills to your private cloud, or automate
your smart home - let PAPA do the work for you.

Think of it as an alternative to IFTTT, *but* it will have two major
improvements: It will be free and open-source software and will provide an
interface so that you can plug in literally any device or service you want.

Design principles
----

* Mistrust authorityâ€”promote decentralization *(from the Hacker ethic)*
* Language-agnostic - Adapters can be written in any language, be it Python,
  Ruby, node.js, Scala, Go, Rust, Java, C#, whatsoever
* General purpose - Do not assume a particular set of use cases/scenarios

Nice to take into account
----
- events that do NOT happen
- monitoring: values that are outside a specified range

Things left to be covered/explored later:
- IFTTT
- huginn
- Proton
- Automator
- "switch all off" scene
